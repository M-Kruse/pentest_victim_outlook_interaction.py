I was setting up a pentest environment and wanted a more interesting way to simulate interacting with a a victim. This script uses selenium to interact with Outlook. At the moment, it goes through emails, looks for easyupload.io links and tries to download and execute the file.

This script is meant to be run on a virtual victim machine in a pentest environment for the purpose of gaining access into the pentest network.

The script will delete the email after interacting with it. 

It can be set on a schedule through cron or Task Scheduler.

The demonstration video uses a Meterpreter executable payload as the uploaded file.
